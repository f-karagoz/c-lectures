C - Input and Output

C programming treats all the devices as files. Devices such as displays are addressed in the same way as files
and three files are automatically opened when a program executes to provide access to keyboard and screen.

Standard File	|	File Pointer	|	Device
----------------------------------------------------
Standard input	|	stdin			|	Keyboard
Standard output	| 	stdout			|	Screen
Standard error	|	stderr			|	Your screen

Ways to read from keyboard and print to screen:
* )	getchar() and putchar()
* )	gets() and puts()
* )	scanf() and printf()

int getchar (void), reads next available character from screen and returns it as an integer.
If you want to read more than one character run this function in a loop.

int putchar (int c), puts the passed character on the screen and return the same character.
This function puts only single character at a time. To display more than one character run
this function in a loop.

char* gets(char * s), function reads a line from 'stdin' file into the buffer pointed to by 's'
until either a terminating newline or EOF (End of File).
Attention: gets() is deprecated!

int puts(const char * s), function writes string 's' and a trailing newline to 'stdout' file.


int scanf(const char * format, ...), function reads the input from the standard input stream 'stdin'
ans scans that input according to the format provided.

int printf(const char * format, ...), function writes the output to the standard output stream 'stdout'
and produces the output according to the format provided.
